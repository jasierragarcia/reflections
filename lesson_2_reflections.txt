What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    - Git creates a .git sub directory where it keeps all the metadata
        for the repository. I need it to start tracking the progress/changes
        in my project.
        
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    1.) Staging Area: Is where you pick the files you want to commit to your repo.
    2.) Working Directory: Is where all your files reside.
    3.) Repository: Where the files and commit history will go.
    - Gives you a chance a to take a look and think about what you are about to commit.
