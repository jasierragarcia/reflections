When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - You want to use a remote repository when you want to collaborate with other
    people and if you want other people to see your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    - Because you might want to know why you are pulling the changes from
        the remote repo, because you don't know if the latest build is
        going to break your working build.
