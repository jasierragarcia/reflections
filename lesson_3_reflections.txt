When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - You want to use a remote repository when you want to collaborate with other
    people and if you want other people to see your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    - Because you might want to know why you are pulling the changes from
        the remote repo, because you don't know if the latest build is
        going to break your working build.
        
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Fork:
        - fork are similar to clones, but the only reason to fork it's if you don't have permission
            to make changes to original repository.
            
            Forking makes a copy of the repo in your github for your own use. Similar to cloning
            but not really.
            
    Clone:
        - You would clone a repo for a repo that you own and if you were granted permission
            from owner of some repo.
            
    Branch:
        - Branches are part of forks and clones and you can also create your own branches,
            if you decided to work on a experimental/special feature that might break the 
            master branch. When the feature is ready for production code then you can merge it to
            the master branch or you can keep in the branch of its own, or you can do the other
            way around, merge the master branch to your exp/special branch that you are working on.
            
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    - The benefit is that you'll be able to work offline and you can merge/push your changes to github when
        you are back online.
